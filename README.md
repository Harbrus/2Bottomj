# The Dragon (Game Jam Project)

You are the predator, you are The Dragon! You will travel through the space fighting horrendous creatures, eating them, becoming larger and evolving in a new being. 

Be careful in your journey though, for your insatiable hunger could be your ruin. You should find a balance to reach harmony, and to face the challenges which lie ahead.

Project Brief Description

- This is a small project for the 2-Buttons Jam 2018.

- Controls are only A and S (plus A+S), even in the menus!

- High contrast colours were chosen for accessibility.

- The main protagonist is a dragon that, like the classic snake, will eat enemies becoming larger and fiercer.

- Boss Fight.

- Super powers unlocked through a meter bar that builds when eating the same kind of enemy of a certain size. This will be your only way to defeat powerful enemies.

- Growing will be a problem because you will be vulnerable to the enemy. Find your balance.

- Stakes, Growth and Balance are the main themes of the game.
